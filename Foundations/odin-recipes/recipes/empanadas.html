    <h1>Empanadas</h1>
    <img src="empanadas.webp" alt="Empanadas pic">
    <p>These are truly traditional beef empanadas from Salta, one of the Northern Provinces in Argentina. Made with ground beef, potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, and a fluffy homemade empanada pastry, these are just to die for! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat and warm through, stirring until salt is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine sifted flour and melted margarine in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Add salt water gradually to the food processor and pulse until a soft dough ball forms that easily separates from the edge of the bowl. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, only if needed. Press dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add cubed potatoes and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and green onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add red peppers and cook for 5 more minutes. Add ground beef and stir with a wooden spoon until fully browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and add to the filling. Toss in chopped eggs and let filling cool down for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pastry from the fridge and knead gently on a floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll out each piece to 1/8-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Cut out 3-inch circles with a pastry cutter or sharp knife and wet the edges lightly with water. Add 1 large tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc. Fold the pastry over, press edges together, and seal with a fork. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool just a little before serving.</li>
            
        </ol>
